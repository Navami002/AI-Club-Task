# AI TASK

With the extensive growth in usage of cars, the newly produced cars are unable to reach the customers for various reasons like high prices, less availability, financial incapability, and so on. Hence the used car market is escalated across the globe but in India, the used car market is in a very nascent stage and mostly dominated by the unorganized sector. This gives chance for fraud while buying a used car. Hence a high precision model is required which will estimate the price of an used car with none bias towards customer or merchandiser. In this fast-moving generation, the present study proposes the newer concept of predicting the prices of certain items. With an idea and motivation to help everyone we came up with a solution to get an appropriate estimate of one's car using Machine Learning Techniques which will save a lot of time and money. A car price prediction has been a high interest research area, as it requires noticeable effort and knowledge of the field expert. This project presents a working model for used car price prediction with a low error value. A considerable number of distinct attributes are examined for reliable and accurate predictions. The results obtained agree with theoretical predictions and have shown improvement over models which use simple linear models. An ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is built by using Keras Regression algorithm namely Keras Regressor. This dataset contains the 9 main attributes of a car which are: Car_Name, Year, Selling_Price, Present_Price, Kms_Driven, Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission, Owner. These attributes are stored in a csv file.
1.	Car_Name: Name of the car [categorical]
2.	Year: Year of purchase of the car [numeric]
3.	Selling_Price: Selling price of the used car [numeric]
4.	Present Price: The present price of the car [numeric]
5.	Kms_Driven: Distance the car has traveled [numeric]
6.	Fuel_Type: Fuel type of the car [categorical]
7.	Seller_Type: From whom the car is bought [categorical]
8.	Transmission: Transmission type of the car [categorical]
9.	Owner: Previously owned by [numeric]

Here R-squared measures the strength of the relationship between the model and the dependent variable on a convenient 0 â€“ 100% scale. The code is building and training a neural network model using the car data to predict the selling price of a car based on various features such as the car's age, mileage, fuel type, seller type, etc. It also evaluates the performance of the model using various metrics such as R-squared, mean squared error, and accuracy on both the training and testing data sets.
